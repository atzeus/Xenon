<a name="what-is-it" class="anchor" href="#what-is-it"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is it?</h2>

<p>Xenon is a middleware abstraction library. It provides a simple programming
interface to various pieces of software that can be used to access distributed
compute and storage resources. </p>

<a name="why-Xenon" class="anchor" href="#why-Xenon"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Xenon?</h2>

<p>Xenon is developed by the Netherlands eScience Center as a support library
for our projects. Several projects develop end-user applications that require
access to distributed compute and storage resources. Xenon provides a simple
API to those resources, allowing those applications to be developed more
rapidly. The experience gained during end-user application development is used
to improve the Xenon API and implementation. </p>
