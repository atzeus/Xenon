What is it?
-----------

Xenon is a middleware abstraction library. It provides a simple
programming interface to various pieces of software that can be used
to access distributed compute and storage resources.

Why Xenon?
----------

Xenon is developed by the Netherlands eScience Center as a support
library for our projects. Several projects develop end-user
applications that require access to distributed compute and storage
resources. Xenon provides a simple API to those resources, allowing
those applications to be developed more rapidly. The experience
gained during end-user application development is used to improve
the Xenon API and implementation.

The Latest Version
------------------

Available in [JCenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter?filterByPkgName=xenon)

Details of the latest official 1.2.2 release of Xenon can be found at:

<https://github.com/NLeSC/Xenon/releases>

Alternatively, the latest development versions of Xenon can be found at:

<https://github.com/NLeSC/Xenon>.

Quick start
-----------

Add Xenon library as a dependency to your project. For a Maven project use
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>nl.esciencecenter.xenon</groupId>
  <artifactId>xenon</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.2</version>
</dependency>
```
For a gradle project make sure to include `jcenter` in the list of repositories, for example:
```
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    jcenter()
}
```
Then include Xenon as a compile dependency:
```
dependencies {
    compile group: 'nl.esciencecenter.xenon', name: 'xenon', version: '1.2.2'
    // other dependencies ...
}
``` 
To compile Xenon from source, download the source distribution below and type:
```
gradlew installDist
```
This will create a binary distribution in `./build/install`

Simple examples
---------------

Here are some examples of basic operations you can perform with Xenon: 

#### Copy a file

Following code copies local /etc/passwd file using ssh to /tmp/password on somemachine:
```
xenon = XenonFactory.newXenon(null);
Files files = xenon.files();
FileSystem sourceFS = files.newFileSystem("local", null, null, null);
FileSystem targetFS = files.newFileSystem("ssh", "somemachine", null, null);
Path sourcePath = files.newPath(sourceFS, new RelativePath("/etc/passwd"));
Path targetPath = files.newPath(targetFS, new RelativePath("/tmp/passwd"));

files.copy(sourcePath, targetPath, CopyOption.CREATE);

files.close(sourceFS);
files.close(targetFS);
XenonFactory.endXenon(xenon);
```

#### Run a job

Following code performs a wordcount of a file on somemachine using ssh:  
```
xenon = XenonFactory.newXenon(null);
Jobs jobs = xenon.jobs();
Scheduler scheduler = jobs.newScheduler("ssh", "somemachine", null, null);
JobDescription description = new JobDescription();
description.setExecutable("/bin/wc");
description.setArguments("-l", "/tmp/passwd");
description.setStdout("/tmp/stdout.txt");

Job job = jobs.submitJob(scheduler, description);

jobs.close(scheduler);
XenonFactory.endXenon(xenon);
```
The output of the job will be written to /tmp/stdout.txt file on somemachine.

Supported middleware
